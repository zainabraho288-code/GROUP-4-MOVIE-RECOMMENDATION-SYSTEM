A movie recommender built on the MovieLens "small" dataset. Given a user's ratings of other movies, it returns **5 movies the user has not seen and is likely to rate highly**.

## 1. Business Problem
### Background
Streaming platforms offer thousands of titles, but users can only
browse a small fraction of them. When viewers cannot quickly find
something they like, they spend less time on the platform, rate fewer
titles, and are more likely to cancel their subscription. Personalised
recommendations are one of the main ways platforms reduce this
discovery problem and keep users engaged.

**How a user provides ratings:** as a Python dictionary of movie title and rating, for example:

```python
{"Toy Story (1995)": 5, "Heat (1995)": 3, "Jumanji (1995)": 4}
```

## 2. Data

- **Source:** MovieLens `ml-latest-small` from the GroupLens research lab, University of Minnesota
- **Link:** https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/
- **Size:** about 100,000 ratings from 610 users on about 9,700 movies
- **Files used:** `ratings.csv` (collaborative filtering) and `movies.csv` (titles and genres for cold start)
- **Files not used:** `tags.csv` and `links.csv` (possible extension)

The dataset is **not stored in this repo**. The notebook downloads it automatically on first run.

## 3. Approach (CRISP-DM)

1. **Business Understanding:** define the problem, success criteria and how users supply ratings
2. **Data Understanding:** sparsity, rating distribution, ratings per user and per movie, genres
3. **Data Preparation:** train/test split, user-item matrix built from training data only
4. **Modeling:**
   - Baseline: movie mean rating
   - Item-based collaborative filtering (cosine similarity on mean-centered ratings)
   - SVD matrix factorisation (comparison)
   - Cold-start hybrid: popularity for new users, genre-based similarity for new movies
5. **Evaluation:** RMSE and MAE on the test set against the baseline, optionally Precision@5
6. **Deployment:** `recommend_top5(user_ratings)` function with a demo user

| Model | RMSE | MAE |
|---|---|---|
| Baseline (movie mean) | | |
| Item-based CF | | |
| SVD | | |

## 5. Repository Structure

## 6. How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tao812-creator/GROUP-4-MOVIE-RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM.git
cd GROUP-4-MOVIE-RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```

Open the notebooks in order. The first notebook downloads the dataset.

## 7. Team and Roles

| Member | GitHub | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| _Name_ | _username_ | Business and Data Understanding (intro, EDA) |
| _Name_ | _username_ | Data Preparation |
| _Name_ | _username_ | Baseline and item-based CF |
| _Name_ | _username_ | SVD and cold-start hybrid |
| Everyone | | Evaluation, `recommend_top5`, README |

## 8. Collaboration Workflow

- Never commit directly to `main`. Work on your own branch (e.g. `yourname-eda`).
- Run `git pull` before you start working.
- Open a Pull Request and have a teammate review it before merging.
- Clear notebook outputs before committing to keep diffs small.
- Each person works in their own notebook to avoid merge conflicts.

## 9. Limitations and Next Steps

- Genres alone are coarse for cold-start recommendations; adding `tags.csv` could improve them.
- Item-based similarity is unreliable for movies with very few ratings.
- Ideas to try next: tuning SVD, hybrid weighting, ranking metrics beyond Precision@5.
